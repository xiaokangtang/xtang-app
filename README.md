# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

(note: this app uses boilerplate from a previous personal project, which is why there are some commits from a year ago, lol.)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run

### `go run src/api.go`

Runs the GoLang Backend script to provide api endpoint

&&

### `npm run start`

Runs the front end app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
